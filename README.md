# ANIMATIVITY
A Matlab based Reflectivity code package to predict body wave propagation through layered anisotropic media.

ANIMATIVITY stands for ANIsotropic MATlab ReflectIVITY, which reveals the function of this software package as computation of the synthetic seismograms after seismic wave propagation through horizontally multi-layered anisotropic medium in different parameterizations.
